* choma's Emacs configuration
This is my personal emacs configuration. It is not meant to be used by anybody
else, but if you take the risk, please report any issue :D

** TODOs
- Configure [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] to read my emails
- Use literate programming in my config with [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][org-babel]]
- Use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]]
- Use [[https://github.com/yasuyk/helm-flycheck/][helm-flycheck]]
